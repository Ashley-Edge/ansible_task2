# Ansible task 2
My second afternoon task to compose a playbook

This afternoons ansible task:
You need to write 3 Ansible roles that will help us configure a 2 node swarm.
	
- The first role should install Docker (This will then be applied to both nodes)
- The second role will initialise the swarm (Applied to the Master node)
- The third role should join the host to the swarm (To be applied to the worker node)

You should store this in a GIT repo and push it to Github before the end of the day.
